# AGENTS.md

## Agent Workflow — Mandatory Checklist

Every request — no matter how small — must follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Gather Context

Before reasoning about the request, collect information:

1. Read relevant `.agents/skills/*.md` files for the domain being touched
2. Use MCP tools to look up any platform/framework APIs you're unsure about
3. Read the source files involved — understand existing patterns, types, and boundaries
4. If the request touches multiple domains, read all relevant skills

Available skills in `.agents/skills/`:

**Platform & Infrastructure:**

| Skill | When to read |
|-------|-------------|
| `tdd/SKILL.md` | Any task that involves writing or modifying tests |
| `api-route/SKILL.md` | Adding or changing Hono API routes |
| `svelte-component/SKILL.md` | Creating or modifying Svelte components |
| `redis-schema/SKILL.md` | Any Redis key/data structure changes |
| `reddit-api/SKILL.md` | Interacting with Reddit API |
| `devvit-config/SKILL.md` | Devvit configuration changes |
| `realtime/SKILL.md` | Live updates, multiplayer, event-driven features |
| `scheduler/SKILL.md` | Cron jobs, delayed tasks, timed events |
| `media-uploads/SKILL.md` | Uploading images to Reddit at runtime |
| `settings-secrets/SKILL.md` | App settings, API keys, per-installation config |

**Game Engagement (MANDATORY — read before building any game feature):**

| Skill | When to read |
|-------|-------------|
| `engagement-loops/SKILL.md` | **ALWAYS** — before building any new feature, mechanic, or screen. The foundational engagement skill. |
| `viral-mechanics/SKILL.md` | Any feature involving sharing, UGC, challenges, or community content |
| `progression-system/SKILL.md` | Streaks, XP, levels, leagues, leaderboards, achievements, flair, or any player progress |
| `daily-content/SKILL.md` | Daily/weekly challenges, scheduled posts, rotating events, or time-limited content |

### Step 2: Clarify Requirements

Ask the user questions until you are ≥90% confident in the implementation approach.

- Cover: expected behavior, edge cases, integration points, constraints, user preferences
- Ask about how this feature interacts with existing code
- Ask about error states and what should happen when things go wrong
- Ask about future extensibility — what might change later?
- Do not proceed until ≥90% confident. It is better to ask one extra question than to build the wrong thing.

**Engagement questions (mandatory for every game feature):**

Before proceeding, answer these internally. If the answer to any is "no" or "unclear", discuss with the user:

1. **Retention**: Does this feature give players a reason to come back tomorrow?
2. **Virality**: Does this feature create content visible to non-players (feed, comments, flair)?
3. **Investment**: Does this feature increase the player's stored value (streak, progress, identity)?
4. **Loop closure**: Does this feature connect back to a trigger for the next session?
5. **First experience**: If a new player encounters this, will they understand it in 3 seconds?

If a feature doesn't serve retention, virality, or investment — question whether it should exist. Every feature must earn its place in the engagement ecosystem.

**Done when:** You can describe the exact changes you'll make, which files you'll touch, what the expected behavior is, AND how it serves the game's engagement loops — and the user confirms.

### Step 3: Plan

Write a brief plan before touching any code:

- Which files will be created or modified?
- What types/interfaces need to change?
- What are the test cases (inputs → expected outputs)?
- Are there any breaking changes to existing code?

**Done when:** You have a concrete list of changes and test cases.

### Step 4: Write Failing Tests (Red)

Write tests before implementation. Only write tests that are relevant to the change — no filler.

1. Check if `__tests__/*.test.ts` exists for the module being changed
2. Add test cases that describe the new/changed behavior
3. Run `bun run test` — confirm the new tests fail (existing tests still pass)

**What must be tested:**

| Layer | Must test | Can skip |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `src/server/**/*.ts` | All routes, handlers, business logic | — |
| `src/server/lib/**/*.ts` | All helpers, validators, transforms | — |
| `src/shared/**/*.ts` | All pure functions | — |
| `src/client/lib/**/*.ts` | Extracted logic files | `.svelte` files |
| Config / docs / skills | — | Always skip |

**Done when:** `bun run test` runs, new tests fail with expected errors, existing tests pass.

### Step 5: Implement (Green)

Write production-grade code to make the failing tests pass. See [Engineering Standards](#engineering-standards) below.

**Done when:** `bun run test` passes with zero failures.

### Step 6: Refactor

Improve the code while keeping tests green:

- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Simplify control flow
- Ensure proper error handling and edge cases
- Verify the code is extensible — will it hold up as the codebase grows?

**Engagement audit (mandatory):**

Before moving to verification, review the feature against these engagement standards:

- [ ] **Hook Model**: Does the feature complete at least one Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment cycle?
- [ ] **Viral surface**: Does the feature create or enhance content visible in the Reddit feed, comments, or flair?
- [ ] **Progression impact**: Does the feature award XP, advance streaks, unlock achievements, or affect league standing?
- [ ] **Social proof**: Does the feature display player counts, leaderboard positions, or community activity?
- [ ] **FOMO/urgency**: If time-limited, does the feature show countdown and "what you missed" for expired content?
- [ ] **One more round**: Does the feature end with a cliffhanger or unfinished business that pulls the player back?
- [ ] **Reddit compliance**: No gameplay gated behind social actions, no auto-posting, all user actions explicit and manual?

If any item fails, improve the feature before shipping. Not every feature needs all items, but every feature must serve at least one engagement loop.

**Done when:** `bun run test` still passes. Code meets engineering standards AND engagement standards.

### Step 7: Verify

```bash
bun run test && bun run type-check
```

**Done when:** Zero test failures, zero type errors.

## Engineering Standards

Write production-grade code. Not prototypes, not MVPs. Code that scales, reads well, and doesn't create debt.

### Single Responsibility
- One function does one thing. One file owns one concern.
- If a function name contains "and" or "or", split it.
- Functions ≤30 lines. If longer, extract helpers.

### Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
- Use types/interfaces to define contracts between modules.
- New behavior should be addable without rewriting existing code.
- Prefer composition over conditionals — don't add `if (newFeature)` branches to existing functions.

### Dependency Inversion
- Depend on interfaces/types, not concrete implementations.
- Pass dependencies as function arguments rather than importing singletons where possible.
- This makes code testable and swappable.

### Pure Functions by Default
- Same input → same output, no side effects.
- No mutation of function arguments — return new values.
- Prefer `map`, `filter`, `reduce` over imperative loops.
- Side effects (API calls, Redis, DOM) live at the boundary, not in business logic.

### Defensive Error Handling
- Fail fast with descriptive errors — never silently swallow failures.
- Handle all edge cases: `null`, `undefined`, empty arrays, missing keys.
- Validate inputs at module boundaries. Trust nothing from external sources.
- Use `unknown` over `any`, then narrow with type guards.

### Readability
- Code reads top-to-bottom — put helpers below their callers.
- Descriptive names over comments: `getUserScore()` not `getVal()`.
- Early returns to avoid nesting: guard → bail, then happy path.
- Max one level of callback nesting — extract named functions.
- Comments explain *why*, never *what*.

### No Dead Weight
- No dead code, no commented-out code, no "just in case" abstractions.
- No unused imports, variables, or parameters.
- If you're not sure it's needed, it's not needed.

## Game Design Standards

This is a Reddit game. Every line of code serves player engagement, retention, and virality. These standards are as mandatory as the engineering standards above.

### The Hooked Model Is the Default Framework

Every feature must complete at least one cycle of **Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment**. If a feature doesn't fit this model, it needs a strong justification for existing. Read `engagement-loops/SKILL.md` before building anything.

### Design for the Reddit Feed

Your game lives in a social feed, not an app store. The inline post preview is your storefront.

- Inline mode must show the game visual + a single CTA — never a loading screen or instructions
- Post titles must create a curiosity gap: "Can you beat today's puzzle? 🧩"
- Social proof must be visible: "1,247 playing today"
- The game must be playable within 3 seconds of the first tap

### Daily Content Is Not Optional

Reddit posts decay within hours. Without daily fresh content, your game disappears.

- Automated daily challenge posts via scheduler (non-negotiable)
- Daily leaderboard resets give everyone a fresh start
- Rotating difficulty across the week serves casual and hardcore players
- Expiry countdowns create honest urgency

### Every Feature Must Serve Retention

Before building, ask: "Does this make someone come back tomorrow?" Retention mechanics:

| Mechanic | Effect | Minimum implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Streaks** | Loss aversion | Track consecutive days, show prominently, include freeze |
| **Daily missions** | Clear goals | 3 rotating missions per day, XP rewards |
| **Progression** | Sunk cost | XP + levels + league tiers |
| **Leaderboards** | Competition | Daily sorted set, player rank always visible |
| **Flair** | Identity investment | Auto-update on progression changes |

### Every Feature Must Serve Virality

Before building, ask: "Does this create content visible to non-players?" Viral mechanics:

| Mechanic | Viral channel | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Score sharing** | Comments | Emoji grid/visual result, reply to stickied comment |
| **Challenges** | New posts | Player-created challenges as UGC posts |
| **Flair** | All of Reddit | League + streak visible everywhere user posts |
| **Daily posts** | Subreddit feed | Automated daily challenge attracts subscribers |
| **Player of the week** | Community post | Automated recognition via scheduler |

### Reddit Policy Compliance (Non-Negotiable)

- ❌ Never gate gameplay behind social actions (posting, commenting, subscribing)
- ❌ Never auto-post or auto-subscribe on behalf of users
- ❌ Never merge gameplay actions with social actions (e.g., "Play Again & Subscribe")
- ✅ All social actions must be explicit, manual, and clearly labeled
- ✅ Score comments must reply to a stickied comment (not top-level, unless custom message)
- ✅ UGC posts must use `runAs: 'USER'` with `userGeneratedContent`
- ✅ Subscribe prompts shown after positive moments, always dismissible

### Session Design

- Core loop completes in under 2 minutes
- First session guarantees a positive outcome (first-win design)
- Sessions end with unfinished business (Zeigarnik effect)
- Near-miss moments show what the player almost achieved
- "One more round" pull is always present

### Monetization Ethics

- Core gameplay is 100% free — no pay-to-win
- Paid features are cosmetic, convenience, or supportive
- No loot boxes, energy systems, or fake scarcity
- "Support this app" option available for fans
- Monetization placed at contextually appropriate moments, never mid-gameplay

---

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- `strict: true` with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`
- Array/object index access returns `T | undefined` — always handle it
- `const` by default, `let` only if reassigned, never `var`
- `as const` for literal arrays/objects
- Explicit return types on exported functions
- Arrow function expressions: `const foo = (): void => {}`

### Naming

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Variables, functions | camelCase | `getUserScore` |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_ATTEMPTS` |
| Types, interfaces | PascalCase | `GameState` |
| Svelte components | PascalCase file | `GameBoard.svelte` |
| Non-component files | kebab-case | `game-logic.ts` |
| API routes | kebab-case | `/api/game-state` |
| Redis keys | colon-delimited | `user:{userId}:stats` |

### Imports

```typescript
// 1. External packages
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import type { Context } from 'hono'

// 2. Local modules
import { createPost } from './post'

// 3. Side-effect imports last
import './app.css'
```

├── client/     # Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 (webview)
├── server/     # Hono.js routes (serverless)
└── shared/     # Shared TypeScript types
```

Data flow: `User Action → Svelte → fetch('/api/...') → Hono → Redis/Reddit API → Response → UI`

Key packages: Svelte 5.x, Tailwind CSS 4.x, Hono, TypeScript 6.x, Vite 8.x, @devvit/web 0.12.x, Bun

## Context Sources

### MCP Tools

Use MCP tools proactively — they give better answers than guessing.

**Svelte MCP:** `list-sections` → `get-documentation` → write code → `svelte-autofixer` (loop until zero issues)

**Devvit MCP:** `devvit_search` for any Devvit/Redis/Reddit API question. Natural language queries work well.

**Sequential Thinking MCP:** `sequentialthinking` for breaking down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning chains. Use when facing multi-step logic, architectural decisions, debugging complex issues, or any task that benefits from structured thinking before acting.

### Web Search

If unsure about an API, library version, or best practice — search the web first. Don't guess. Prefer official docs and recent sources.
