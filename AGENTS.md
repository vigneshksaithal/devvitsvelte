## MCP Servers

### Svelte MCP Server: Available Tools

You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively.

#### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

#### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

#### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

#### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.

### Devvit MCP Server: Available Tools

You are able to use the Devvit MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Devvit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively.

#### 1. devvit_search

Executes search over all of Devvit documentation. This is preferable to pasting in tons of docs since it can be more specific and lowers the risk of polluting your context.

## Guiding Principles

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Keep code simple and intention-revealing. 
- Keep functions small (SHOULD target <= 20–30 lines) and single-purpose.
- Make code review a first-class practice. Optimize for readability, small CLs, and respectful, actionable feedback.
- Consistency: Maintain a unified design system (color tokens, typography, spacing, components).
- Simplicity: Prefer small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Visual Quality: Uphold a high standard of visual polish per OSS guidelines (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.).

### Review Criteria

- The code is well-designed.
- The functionality is good for the users of the code.
- Any UI changes are sensible and look good.
- Any parallel programming is done safely.
- The code isn't more complex than it needs to be.
- The developer isn't implementing things they might need in the future but don't know they need now.
- Code has appropriate unit tests.
- Tests are well-designed.
- The developer used clear names for everything.
- Comments are clear and useful, and mostly explain why instead of what.
- Code is appropriately documented.
- The code conforms to the style guides.

## Code Style

### General

- Omit semicolons unless syntactically required.
- Favor functional programming patterns over object-oriented programming patterns.
- Sort imports: packages, shared modules, then relative paths.
- Prefer named exports (tree-shaking) over default exports.
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names
- Use descriptive function names instead of generic names like `handle` or `process`.

### Svelte

- Svelte components: PascalCase filenames, export props via `$props()` rune, keep markup declarative.
- Create reusable components in `src/client/components` before duplicating markup.
- Use arrow functions for all functions.
- Write short, focused components with a single responsibility.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> - DO NOT use style blocks in Svelte components unless absolutely necessary.
> - Use Tailwind CSS classes and existing design tokens.

### Server

- Server handlers: Small, pure functions registered on shared `Hono` instance.
- Validate external input using `src/shared/validator.ts` before mutating state.
- Serverless Node.js: all Node globals except `fs`, `http`, `https`, and `net` are available.
- Use `fetch` instead of `http`/`https`.
- File system is read-only; you cannot write files.
- Do not install libraries requiring restricted modules.
- Websockets and HTTP streaming are not supported.
- Redis is accessible via `import { redis } from '@devvit/web/server'`.
- Clients must not rely on `localStorage`.

### Shared

- Shared utilities must be framework-agnostic and deterministic; no side-effects. They must be testable from both client and server.
- Colocate Vitest test files next to the module under test (e.g. `generator.test.ts`, `validator.test.ts`). Use lightweight fakes over live services.

### Devvit

Refer to "devvit app" (`/src/devvit`) and "client" (`/src/client`).

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This is a serverless runtime (like AWS Lambda); do not run SQLite or stateful in-memory processes. 
> For real-time use cases, see `devvit_search` docs regarding the real-time service.

## Development Workflow

Follow the following workflow:

1. Explore → Plan → Code → Commit
2. Test-First Workflow (TDD)
3. Start Development

### 1. Explore → Plan → Code → Commit

- Begin with a concise checklist (3–7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.
- Read the code; DO NOT begin coding immediately.
- Proceed to code ONLY if you are >90% sure about the approach.
- Plan your approach; write a detailed plan of what you will do.
- Ask questions if unclear — **DO NOT ASSUME**.
- Break tasks into smaller steps.
- Request user approval for your plan before coding.
- Iterate: Review → Approve → Code → Verify → Commit.

### 2. Test-First Workflow (TDD)

- Write failing tests first.
- Implement until tests pass.
- Guard against overfitting.

### 3. Start Development

- Run `pnpm dev` to start development.
- Modify code as needed in client/server/shared.
- Test with `pnpm test`.
- Type-check with `pnpm type-check`.
- Format and lint with `pnpm fix`.

---

## Git Workflows

- Use conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc.), limiting the subject to 72 characters. Add context in the body for non-trivial changes.
- Branches: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`
- Use rebase as the default merge method; avoid force-pushing to `main`.
- Commit messages:
  - Start with an imperative verb.
  - Always type-check before committing.
  - Example: `feat(auth): add token validation`

## Repository Etiquette

- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Update `AGENTS.md` with every new workflow or major tool.
- Never commit secrets or local settings.
- After updates, write a detailed changelog in `CHANGELOG.md`.

> **NOTE:** This file is the single source of truth for project workflows, tools, and conventions. Keep it current with every addition or change.
> **REMEMBER:** After coding you need to update the CHANGELOG.md file with a detailed summary of changes made.

## Linter and Formatter Rules

### Before Writing Code

1. Analyze codebase patterns
2. Consider edge cases and errors
3. Apply all rules strictly
4. Validate accessibility

### Core Principles

Write code that is **clean, readable, accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`
- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity and readability
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Svelte:**

- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

### Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting
